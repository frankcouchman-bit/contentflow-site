    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 19, 2025</p>

    <p>ContentRepurpose.pro (“<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”) provides tools that transform your source content into channel-ready drafts for LinkedIn, X, Email, Instagram, and more. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and the rights you have.</p>

    <h2>Who we are</h2>

    <h2>Data we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account data:</strong> email, name (if provided), authentication identifiers.</li>
      <li><strong>Billing data:</strong> handled by Stripe (card details never hit our servers). We store plan, status, and Stripe customer/price IDs.</li>

      <li><strong>Content you submit:</strong> source text, titles, briefs, and the outputs generated for you.</li>
      <li><strong>BYOK/API keys (optional):</strong> If you choose “Bring Your Own Key,” your model API key is used only to fulfill your requests. By default we do <em>not</em> store your BYOK key; if you explicitly opt to save it, we store it encrypted and you can delete it anytime from your settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrations (optional):</strong> If you connect services (e.g., Notion, Trello, Buffer), we store the minimum tokens/IDs required to perform the export. You can disconnect at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Device & log data:</strong> IP address, browser/OS, pages viewed, referrers, basic server logs for security and debugging.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies & similar tech:</strong> essential cookies for session and security; optional analytics/ads cookies on marketing pages (see “Analytics & Advertising”).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legal bases (GDPR)</h2>

      <li>Error/security logs: typically rotated within 30–180 days unless needed for investigations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use encryption in transit (HTTPS) and industry-standard safeguards. No method is 100% secure; we continuously improve our controls.</p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your region (e.g., EU/EEA, UK, California), you may have rights to access, correct, delete, port, or object to processing. Contact <a href="mailto:support@contentrepurpose.pro">support@contentrepurpose.pro</a>. We may verify identity before fulfilling requests.</p>

    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>We may process data in countries outside your own. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs) with processors.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>Our service is not directed to children under 16. If we learn we collected such data, we’ll delete it.</p>

    <h2>Data Processing Addendum (DPA)</h2>
    <p>For business users who need a DPA, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@contentrepurpose.pro">support@contentrepurpose.pro</a> and we’ll execute our standard DPA covering GDPR/UK GDPR.</p>
